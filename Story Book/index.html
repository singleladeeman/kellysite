            Once there was a gentleman who married, 
            for his second wife, the proudest and most 
            haughty1 woman that was ever seen. She had,
            by a former husband, two daughters of her own,
            who were, indeed, exactly like her in all things.
            He had likewise, by another wife, a young daughter,
            but of unparalleled2 goodness and sweetness of temper, 
            which she took from her mother, who was the best creature 
            in the world.

            No sooner were the ceremonies of the wedding over but the stepmother 
            began to show herself in her true colors. She could not bear the good qualities 
            of this pretty girl, and the less because they made her own daughters appear the more odious.
            She employed her in the meanest work
            of the house. She scoured4 the dishes, tables,
            etc., and cleaned madam’s chamber, and those of
            misses, her daughters. She slept in a sorry
            garret, on a wretched straw bed, while her
            sisters slept in fine rooms, with floors all inlaid, 
            on beds of the very newest fashion, and where they had looking glasses so large that 
            they could see themselves at their full length from head to foot.

            The poor girl bore it all patiently, and dared not tell her father, who would have scolded her; for his wife 
            governed him entirely. When she had done her work, she used to go to the chimney corner, and sit down there 
            in the cinders and ashes, which caused her to be called Cinderwench. Only the younger sister, who was not so 
            rude and uncivil8 as the older one, called her Cinderella. However, Cinderella,
            notwithstanding her coarse apparel, was a hundred times more beautiful than her sisters, although
            they were always dressed very richly.

            It happened that the king’s son gave a ball, and invited all persons of fashion to it. Our young misses
            were also invited, for they cut a very grand figure among those of quality. They were mightily delighted
            at this invitation, and wonderfully busy in selecting the gowns, petticoats, and hair dressing that
            would best become them. This was a new difficulty for Cinderella; for it was she who ironed her sister’s 
            linen and pleated their ruffles. They talked all day long of nothing but how they should be dressed.

            “For my part,” said the eldest, “I will wear my red velvet suit with French trimming.”
            “And I,” said the youngest, “shall have my usual petticoat; but then, to make amends11 for that, I will put
            on my gold-flowered cloak, and my diamond stomacher,which is far from being the most ordinary one in the world.”
            They sent for the best hairdresser they could get to make up their headpieces and adjust their hairdos, and they 
            They also consulted Cinderella in all these matters, for she had excellent ideas, and her advice was always good.
             Indeed, she even offered her services to fix their hair, which they very willingly accepted. As she was doing this,
              they said to her, “Cinderella, would you not like to go to the ball?”
            “Alas!” said she, “you only jeer13 me; it is not for such as I am to go to such a place.”
            “You are quite right,” they replied. “It would make the people laugh to see a Cinderwench at a ball.”
            Anyone but Cinderella would have fixed their hair awry, but she was very good, and dressed them perfectly well. 
            They were so excited that they hadn’t eaten a thing for almost two days. Then they broke more than a dozen laces 
            trying to have themselves laced up tightly enough to give them a fine slender14 shape. They were continually in front of their looking glass.
            At last the happy day came. They went to court, and Cinderella followed them with her eyes as long as she could. When
             she lost sight of them, she started to cry.had their red brushes and patches from Mademoiselle de la Poche.
             Her godmother, who saw her all in tears, asked her what was the matter.
            “I wish I could. I wish I could.” She was not able to speak the rest, being interrupted by her tears and sobbing.
